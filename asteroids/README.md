## Lesson Complete! What's Next?

Congratulations on completing the project! It's always a great practice to solidify what you learn in courses by getting your hands dirty with a real-world application.

You have successfully implemented all the required steps. Now, it's time to make this project your own.

### ðŸš€ Extending the Project

If you'd like to continue building and add your own creative touch, here are some ideas to get you started:

* **Add a scoring system:** Keep track of points for destroying asteroids.
* **Implement multiple lives and respawning:** Give the player more than one chance.
* **Add an explosion effect:** Create a visual effect for when asteroids are destroyed.
* **Add acceleration to player movement:** Make the ship's movement feel more realistic.
* **Make objects wrap around the screen:** Instead of disappearing at the edges, have them reappear on the opposite side.
* **Add a background image:** Give your game a dynamic or static backdrop.
* **Create different weapon types:** Implement lasers, spread shots, or missiles.
* **Make asteroids lumpy:** Use procedural generation for non-circular asteroid shapes.
* **Implement a triangular hitbox:** Create a more precise hitbox for the player's ship.
* **Add a shield power-up:** Allow the player to collect a temporary shield.
* **Add a speed power-up:** Let the player collect an item for a temporary speed boost.
* **Add bombs:** Implement a special weapon that clears the screen of asteroids.
